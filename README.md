# marco-tracker

**Live Link: https://melodious-mousse-e733b1.netlify.app**

This is the final project for [learnjavascript.online](https://learnjavascript.online) .

This project is a food tracker app that allows users to select a food from the dropdown menu and track the macros. A chart will display the total calories and macros tracked. This app is a good learning experience for ES6 JavaScript. Concepts used in the app includes:

- Data structures (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, arrays of objects) and their associated methods
- if conditions
- Iterations and Reduce
- Optional chaining & nullish coalescing
- Classes
- Fetch API and the FetchWrapper
- Modules & importing packages
- DOM (selection, events, etc.)
- Closures

Also learned how to:

- integrate two 3rd party libraries: snackbar and chart.js
- think about refactoring and DRY
- refactor duplicate code
- use classes to store application data/state
- work with a generic API (Firebase API)
